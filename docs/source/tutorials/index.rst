In the tutorials, we first look at the Gymnasium and PettingZoo environments that integrate navground. Then, we use them to train navigation policies in different scenarios. 

Our goal here is not to train the best possible policies or to perform a rigorous comparison between algorithms. In fact, we do not optimize hyper-parameters. Instead we want to show how `navground.learning` can be used to learn navigation policies in increasingly complex scenarios.
